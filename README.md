Instructions for use

Running the code will require MATLAB and Simulink, as well as the Wavelet Toolbox.

Download copies of the .m-files and .slx-files.

Open the SingleFault.m or DoubleFault.m file, and specify values for the parameters as required.  The user can either simulate one fault or two faults depending which .m-file was opened.

Descriptions of other .m-files are contained in the .m-files.
